This is a plugin for the Community Sensor Model, version 3.0.  See https://github.com/sminster/csm.

This project is not complete, and only shows how such a plugin could be made.  Things that are not done are lised in the TODO section.

Authors
-------
This code was primarily written by Scott Minster and John Karp of Harris Corporation.

Compiling
---------
This plugin library can theoretically be compiled on Linux i386, x86_64, or IA-64, Solaris Sparc (32 or 64 bit, with or without the "stlport" mode) and x86, and Windows by using the appropriate Makefile when building.  However, it has only been tested on Linux x86_64 on RHEL5:

   make -f Makefile.linux64 all install clean

The build requires the CSM3 and TSM 2A library and include files.  These can be set in the Makefile, or set on the command line:

  make -f Makefile.linux64 all install clean CSMHOME=/path/to/csm3 TSMHOME=/path/to/tsm2a

By default, the built files are placed in an architecture subdirectory in the build area.  This allows multiple architectures to be built.  To specify a different intallation directory, set the INSTDIR make variable:

  make -f Makefile.linux64 all install clean INSTDIR=/path/to/csm3/install/dir

Compiling makes a csm2to3 shared library (libcsm2to3.so.1.0 on UNIX, csm2to3.dll on Windows) that can be loaded by CSM clients (Sensor Exploitation Tools, or SETs).

TODO
----
* Come up with better way to locate CSM and TSM libraries.  Maybe autoconf?

* csm2to3plugin::loadTsmPlugins() is not implemented, so the library doesn't load any TSM-2A plugin libraries.  There are complications doing this, such as determining where to find those library files and setting the appropriate environment variables.  If the 2A plugins are already loaded, then this plugin should detect them and translate them to the CSM3 interface.

* csm2to3model::getCrossCovarianceMatrix() is not fully implemented.

* Several informational methods in csm2to3model are default implemented:
  - getVersion()
  - getModelName()
  - getSensorType()
  - getSensorMode()
